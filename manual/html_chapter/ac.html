  <h2 class="chapter">1 <code>ac</code></h2>

  <p><a name="index-ac-1" id="index-ac-1"></a><a name=
  "index-connect-time-2" id="index-connect-time-2"></a> The
  <code>ac</code> command prints out a report of connect time (in
  hours) based on the logins/logouts in the current
  <code>wtmp</code> file. A total is also printed out.</p>

  <p>The accounting file <code>wtmp</code> is maintained by
  <code>init</code> and <code>login</code>. Neither of these
  programs creates the file; if the file is not there, no
  accounting is done. To begin accounting, create the file with a
  length of zero. <strong>NOTE:</strong> the <code>wtmp</code> file
  can get really big, really fast. You might want to trim it every
  once and a while.</p>

  <p>GNU <code>ac</code> works nearly the same u*x <code>ac</code>,
  though it's a little smarter in its printing out of daily
  totals&mdash;it actually prints <em>every</em> day, rather than
  skipping to the date of the next entry in the <code>wtmp</code>
  file.</p>

  <h3 class="section">1.1 Flags</h3>

  <p>All of the original <code>ac</code>'s options have been
  implemented, and a few have been added. Normally, when
  <code>ac</code> is invoked, the output looks like this:</p>
  <pre class="example">
             total 93867.14
</pre>

  <p class="noindent">where total is the number of hours of connect
  time for every entry in the <code>wtmp</code> file. The rest of
  the flags modify the output in one way or another.</p>

  <dl>
    <dt><code>-d</code></dt>

    <dt><code>--daily-totals</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Print totals for each day rather than just one big total at
      the end. The output looks like this:
      <pre class="example">
          Jul  3  total     1.17
          Jul  4  total     2.10
          Jul  5  total     8.23
          Jul  6  total     2.10
          Jul  7  total     0.30
</pre><br>
    </dd>

    <dt><code>-p</code></dt>

    <dt><code>--individual-totals</code></dt>

    <dd>
      Print time totals for each user in addition to the usual
      everything-lumped-into-one value. It looks like:
      <pre class="example">
                  bob       8.06
                  goff      0.60
                  maley     7.37
                  root      0.12
                  total    16.15
</pre><br>
    </dd>

    <dt><var>people</var></dt>

    <dd>Print out the sum total of the connect time used by all of
    the users included in people. Note that people is a space
    separated list of valid user names; wildcards are not
    allowed.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>-f</code> <var>filename</var></dt>

    <dt><code>--file</code> <var>filename</var></dt>

    <dd>Read from the file <var>filename</var> instead of the
    system's <code>wtmp</code> file.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>--complain</code></dt>

    <dd>When the <code>wtmp</code> file has a problem (a time-warp,
    missing record, or whatever), print out an appropriate
    error.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>--reboots</code></dt>

    <dd>Reboot records are <em>not</em> written at the time of a
    reboot, but when the system restarts; therefore, it is
    impossible to know <var>exactly</var> when the reboot occurred.
    Users may have been logged into the system at the time of the
    reboot, and many <code>ac</code>'s automatically count the time
    between the login and the reboot record against the user (even
    though all of that time <em>shouldn't</em> be, perhaps, if the
    system is down for a long time, for instance). If you want to
    count this time, include the flag. <strong>To make</strong>
    <code>ac</code> <strong>behave like the one that was
    distributed with your OS, include this flag.</strong><br></dd>

    <dt><code>--supplants</code></dt>

    <dd>Sometimes a logout record is not written for a specific
    terminal, so the time that the last user accrued cannot be
    calculated. If you want to include the time from the user's
    login to the next login on the terminal (though probably
    incorrect), include this flag. <strong>To make</strong>
    <code>ac</code> <strong>behave like the one that was
    distributed with your OS, include this flag.</strong><br></dd>

    <dt><code>--timewarps</code></dt>

    <dd>Sometimes, entries in a <code>wtmp</code> file will
    suddenly jump back into the past without a clock change record
    occurring. It is impossible to know how long a user was logged
    in when this occurs. If you want to count the time between the
    login and the time warp against the user, include this flag.
    <strong>To make</strong> <code>ac</code> <strong>behave like
    the one that was distributed with your OS, include this
    flag.</strong><br></dd>

    <dt><code>--compatibility</code></dt>

    <dd>This is shorthand for typing out the three above
    options.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>-a</code></dt>

    <dt><code>--all-days</code></dt>

    <dd>If we're printing daily totals, print a record for every
    day instead of skipping intervening days where there is no
    login activity. Without this flag, time accrued during those
    intervening days gets listed under the next day where there is
    login activity.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>-y</code></dt>

    <dt><code>--print-year</code></dt>

    <dd>Print out the year when displaying dates.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>--print-zeros</code></dt>

    <dd>If a total for any category (save the grand total) is zero,
    print it. The default is to suppress printing.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>--debug</code></dt>

    <dd>Print verbose internal information.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>--tw-leniency</code> <var>value</var></dt>

    <dd>Set the time warp leniency value (in seconds). Records in
    <code>wtmp</code> files might be slightly out of order (most
    notably when two logins occur within a one-second period
    &ndash; the second one gets written first). By default, this
    value is set to 1 second. Some <code>wtmp</code>'s are really
    screwed up (Suns) and require a larger value here. If the
    program notices this problem, time is not assigned to users
    unless the <code>--timewarps</code> flag is used. See the
    Problems section for more information.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>--tw-suspicious</code> <var>value</var></dt>

    <dd>Set the time warp suspicious value (in seconds). If two
    records in the <code>wtmp</code> file are farther than this
    number of seconds apart, there is a problem with the wtmp file
    (or your machine hasn't been used in a year). If the program
    notices this problem, time is not assigned to users unless the
    <code>--timewarps</code> flag is used.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>-V</code></dt>

    <dt><code>--version</code></dt>

    <dd>Print <code>ac</code>'s version number.<br></dd>

    <dt><code>-h</code></dt>

    <dt><code>--help</code></dt>

    <dd>Print <code>ac</code>'s usage string and default locations
    of system files to standard output.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h3 class="section">1.2 Problems</h3>

  <p>For no fault of <code>ac</code>'s, if two logins occur at the
  same time (within a second of each other), each
  <code>login</code> process will try to write an entry to the
  <code>wtmp</code> file. With file system overhead, it is
  forseeable that the entries would get written in the wrong order.
  GNU <code>ac</code> automatically compensates for this, but some
  other <code>ac</code>s may not... beware.</p>

  <h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">The FTP Problem</h5>

  <p>I've tested the standard <code>ac</code> in Ultrix 4.2
  (DECstation/DECsystem), SunOS 4.1.1 (Sun3, Sun4, Sparc), Mach 2.5
  (Omron/Luna), and DomainOS 10.3 (DN3500). All of these
  <code>ac</code>s have trouble parsing entries in which the line
  is <code>ftp</code><var>xxxx</var> (<var>xxxx</var> being some
  number). Whenever these <code>ac</code>s see one of these
  entries, they log everyone out at the time of the entry.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><strong>HOW IT HAPPENS:</strong> if there is
  a user logged into the machine when an ftp connection occurs,
  (minimally) you'll get a login record for the user, a login
  record for the ftp connection, and the logouts for both
  afterwards (in either order).</p>

  <p class="noindent"><strong>TANGIBLE RESULT:</strong> the user
  who was logged in gets 'logged out' at the time the ftp
  connection begins, and none of the time spent during or after the
  ftp connection. Therefore, when you run GNU <code>ac</code>, the
  totals will most likely be greater than those of your system's
  <code>ac</code> (provided you specify the other flags that will
  make GNU <code>ac</code> behave like the system's).</p>

  <h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">The Shutdown/Reboot Problem</h5>

  <p>On Suns, <code>init</code> is a little screwed up. For some
  reason, after a shutdown record is written, a reboot record is
  written with a time-stamp <em>before</em> the shutdown (less than
  30 seconds, usually).</p>

  <p class="noindent"><strong>TANGIBLE RESULT:</strong> GNU
  <code>ac</code> will notice the problem, log everyone out (you
  can specify if you want the time to be added to the user's total)
  and begin a new day entry based on the time of the out-of-sync
  record. If you try to print out daily totals, you'll notice that
  some days might have two or more entries.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> To fix this, a
  timewarp leniency value has been implemented. If any record is
  out of order by this number of seconds (defaults to 60) it gets
  ignored. If you need to change this value (if you think the
  totals are off because the value is too high), you can change it
  using the &lsquo;<samp><span class=
  "samp">--timewarp-value</span></samp>&rsquo; flag. The rationale
  for the 60 second default is that of all of the machines with
  this problem, the largest timewarp was 45.</p>

  <h5 class="unnumberedsubsubsec">Stupid System V Machines</h5>

  <p>Some <code>ac</code>'s on System V machines (I've tried SGI
  Indigo &amp; SGI Indy) forget to pay attention to the
  <code>ut_type</code> field in a <code>struct utmp</code>. As
  such, they chalk up a lot of time to non-existant processes
  called <code>LOGIN</code> or <code>runlevel</code>.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><strong>TANGIBLE RESULT:</strong> The amount
  of total time reported by the system's <code>ac</code> is
  <strong>really</strong> off. Often, it's several times greater
  than what it should be.</p>

  <p class="noindent"><strong>SOLUTION:</strong> GNU
  <code>ac</code> always pays attention to the <code>ut_type</code>
  record, so there's no possibility of chalking up time to anything
  but user processes. <!--  --></p>
