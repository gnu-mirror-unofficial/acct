<H1><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="accounting_toc.html#TOC4"><CODE>ac</CODE></A></H1>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>

</P>
<P>
The <CODE>ac</CODE> command prints out a report of connect time (in hours)
based on the logins/logouts in the current <CODE>wtmp</CODE> file.
A total is also printed out.

</P>
<P>
The accounting file <CODE>wtmp</CODE> is maintained by <CODE>init</CODE>
and <CODE>login</CODE>.  Neither of these programs creates the file; if the
file is not there, no accounting is done.  To begin accounting, create
the file with a length of zero.  <STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> the
<CODE>wtmp</CODE> file can get really big, really fast.  You might
want to trim it every once and a while.

</P>
<P>
GNU <CODE>ac</CODE> works nearly the same u*x <CODE>ac</CODE>, though it's a little
smarter in its printing out of daily totals--it actually prints
<EM>every</EM> day, rather than skipping to the date of the next entry in
the <CODE>wtmp</CODE> file.

</P>


<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="accounting_toc.html#TOC5">Flags</A></H2>

<P>
All of the original <CODE>ac</CODE>'s options have been implemented, and a few have
been added.  Normally, when <CODE>ac</CODE> is invoked, the output looks like
this:

<PRE>
        total 93867.14
</PRE>

<P>
where total is the number of hours of connect time for every entry in
the <CODE>wtmp</CODE> file.  The rest of the flags modify the
output in one way or another.

</P>
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--daily-totals</CODE>
<DD>
Print totals for each day rather than just one big total at the end.
The output looks like this:

<PRE>
Jul  3  total     1.17
Jul  4  total     2.10
Jul  5  total     8.23
Jul  6  total     2.10
Jul  7  total     0.30
</PRE>

<DT><CODE>-p</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--individual-totals</CODE>
<DD>
Print time totals for each user in addition to the usual
everything-lumped-into-one value.  It looks like:

<PRE>
        bob       8.06
        goff      0.60
        maley     7.37
        root      0.12
        total    16.15
</PRE>

<DT><CODE><VAR>people</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Print out the sum total of the connect time used by all of the users
included in people.  Note that people is a space separated list of valid
user names; wildcards are not allowed.

<DT><CODE>-f <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--file <VAR>filename</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Read from the file <VAR>filename</VAR> instead of the system's
<CODE>wtmp</CODE> file.

<DT><CODE>--complain</CODE>
<DD>
When the <CODE>wtmp</CODE> file has a problem (a time-warp, missing
record, or whatever), print out an appropriate error.

<DT><CODE>--reboots</CODE>
<DD>
Reboot records are <EM>not</EM> written at the time of a reboot, but when
the system restarts; therefore, it is impossible to know <VAR>exactly</VAR>
when the reboot occurred.  Users may have been logged into the system at
the time of the reboot, and many <CODE>ac</CODE>'s automatically count the
time between the login and the reboot record against the user (even
though all of that time <EM>shouldn't</EM> be, perhaps, if the system is
down for a long time, for instance).  If you want to count this time,
include the flag.  <STRONG>To make <CODE>ac</CODE> behave like the one that
was distributed with your OS, include this flag.</STRONG>

<DT><CODE>--supplants</CODE>
<DD>
Sometimes a logout record is not written for a specific terminal, so the
time that the last user accrued cannot be calculated.  If you want to
include the time from the user's login to the next login on the terminal
(though probably incorrect), include this flag.  <STRONG>To make
<CODE>ac</CODE> behave like the one that was distributed with your OS, include
this flag.</STRONG>

<DT><CODE>--timewarps</CODE>
<DD>
Sometimes, entries in a <CODE>wtmp</CODE> file will suddenly jump
back into the past without a clock change record occurring.  It is
impossible to know how long a user was logged in when this occurs.  If
you want to count the time between the login and the time warp against
the user, include this flag.  <STRONG>To make <CODE>ac</CODE> behave like the
one that was distributed with your OS, include this flag.</STRONG>

<DT><CODE>--compatibility</CODE>
<DD>
This is shorthand for typing out the three above options.

<DT><CODE>-a</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--all-days</CODE>
<DD>
If we're printing daily totals, print a record for every day instead of
skipping intervening days where there is no login activity.  Without
this flag, time accrued during those intervening days gets listed under
the next day where there is login activity.

<DT><CODE>-y</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--print-year</CODE>
<DD>
Print out the year when displaying dates.

<DT><CODE>--print-zeros</CODE>
<DD>
If a total for any category (save the grand total) is zero, print it.
The default is to suppress printing.

<DT><CODE>--debug</CODE>
<DD>
Print verbose internal information.

<DT><CODE>--tw-leniency <VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set the time warp leniency value (in seconds).  Records in
<CODE>wtmp</CODE> files might be slightly out of order (most
notably when two logins occur within a one-second period -- the second
one gets written first).  By default, this value is set to 1 second.
Some <CODE>wtmp</CODE>'s are really screwed up (Suns) and require a
larger value here.  If the program notices this problem, time is not
assigned to users unless the <CODE>--timewarps</CODE> flag is used.  See the
Problems section for more information.

<DT><CODE>--tw-suspicious <VAR>value</VAR></CODE>
<DD>
Set the time warp suspicious value (in seconds).  If two records in the
<CODE>wtmp</CODE> file are farther than this number of seconds
apart, there is a problem with the wtmp file (or your machine
hasn't been used in a year).  If the program notices this problem, time
is not assigned to users unless the <CODE>--timewarps</CODE> flag is used.

<DT><CODE>-V</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--version</CODE>
<DD>
Print <CODE>ac</CODE>'s version number.

<DT><CODE>-h</CODE>
<DD>
<DT><CODE>--help</CODE>
<DD>
Print <CODE>ac</CODE>'s usage string and default locations of system files to
standard output.
</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="accounting_toc.html#TOC6">Problems</A></H2>

<P>
For no fault of <CODE>ac</CODE>'s, if two logins occur at the same time
(within a second of each other), each <CODE>login</CODE> process will try to
write an entry to the <CODE>wtmp</CODE> file.  With file system
overhead, it is forseeable that the entries would get written in the
wrong order.  GNU <CODE>ac</CODE> automatically compensates for this, but some
other <CODE>ac</CODE>s may not...  beware.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="accounting_toc.html#TOC7">The FTP Problem</A></H4>

<P>
I've tested the standard <CODE>ac</CODE> in Ultrix 4.2 (DECstation/DECsystem),
SunOS 4.1.1 (Sun3, Sun4, Sparc), Mach 2.5 (Omron/Luna), and DomainOS
10.3 (DN3500).  All of these <CODE>ac</CODE>s have trouble parsing entries in
which the line is <CODE>ftp</CODE><VAR>xxxx</VAR> (<VAR>xxxx</VAR> being some number).
Whenever these <CODE>ac</CODE>s see one of these entries, they log everyone
out at the time of the entry.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>HOW IT HAPPENS:</STRONG> if there is a user logged into the machine when
an ftp connection occurs, (minimally) you'll get a login record for the
user, a login record for the ftp connection, and the logouts for both
afterwards (in either order).

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>TANGIBLE RESULT:</STRONG> the user who was logged in gets 'logged out'
at the time the ftp connection begins, and none of the time spent during
or after the ftp connection.  Therefore, when you run GNU <CODE>ac</CODE>,
the totals will most likely be greater than those of your system's
<CODE>ac</CODE> (provided you specify the other flags that will make GNU
<CODE>ac</CODE> behave like the system's).

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="accounting_toc.html#TOC8">The Shutdown/Reboot Problem</A></H4>

<P>
On Suns, <CODE>init</CODE> is a little screwed up.  For some reason, after a
shutdown record is written, a reboot record is written with a time-stamp
<EM>before</EM> the shutdown (less than 30 seconds, usually).

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>TANGIBLE RESULT:</STRONG> GNU <CODE>ac</CODE> will notice the problem, log
everyone out (you can specify if you want the time to be added to the
user's total) and begin a new day entry based on the time of the
out-of-sync record.  If you try to print out daily totals, you'll notice
that some days might have two or more entries.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>SOLUTION:</STRONG> To fix this, a timewarp leniency value has been
implemented.  If any record is out of order by this number of seconds
(defaults to 60) it gets ignored.  If you need to change this value (if
you think the totals are off because the value is too high), you can
change it using the <SAMP>`--timewarp-value'</SAMP> flag.  The rationale for the
60 second default is that of all of the machines with this problem, the
largest timewarp was 45.

</P>


<H4><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="accounting_toc.html#TOC9">Stupid System V Machines</A></H4>

<P>
Some <CODE>ac</CODE>'s on System V machines (I've tried SGI Indigo &#38; SGI Indy)
forget to pay attention to the <CODE>ut_type</CODE> field in a <CODE>struct
utmp</CODE>.  As such, they chalk up a lot of time to non-existant processes
called <CODE>LOGIN</CODE> or <CODE>runlevel</CODE>.  

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>TANGIBLE RESULT:</STRONG> The amount of total time reported by the
system's <CODE>ac</CODE> is <STRONG>really</STRONG> off.  Often, it's several times
greater than what it should be.

</P>
<P>
<STRONG>SOLUTION:</STRONG> GNU <CODE>ac</CODE> always pays attention to the
<CODE>ut_type</CODE> record, so there's no possibility of chalking up time to
anything but user processes.
